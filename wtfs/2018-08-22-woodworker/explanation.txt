Because a lot of php string search functions have this nice note in the documentation

  "If needle is not a string, it is converted to an integer and
  applied as the ordinal value of a character."

Which bascially means the Integer in this example will be run throug chr()
and chr(10010319) === _ and chr(1337) === 9
