In this WTF, PHP's typecasting is the root of all evil.

Because we give the switch statement an integer all case block keys will
be converted to integers.
And we all know that string that do not contain any number as first
charachter the string will be converted to 0

And if we check for 'test' and 0 and the string comparsion is before the
integer comparsion we are lost.

So we learn not to mix types in a switch block.
